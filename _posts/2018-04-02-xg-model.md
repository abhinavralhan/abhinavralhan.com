This is a blog discussing what Expected Goals (xG) is, how it works, and my first attempt at creating one.

## What is xG?

The core idea is to **quantify the likelihood of a goal being scored from a particular shot attempt** (or other scoring chance). This concept is quite intuitive when you think about it - not all shots are created equal.

A shot from 6 yards out, directly in front of goal, has a much higher probability of resulting in a goal than a long-range effort from 30 yards at a tight angle.

## How Does It Work?

Expected Goals models use historical data to calculate the probability that any given shot will result in a goal. The model looks at thousands of previous shots with similar characteristics and determines what percentage of those shots were converted.

### Key Factors

The most common factors used in an xG model are:

- **Distance** - How far from goal the shot was taken
- **Angle** - The angle to goal from the shot location
- **Shot type** - Header, normal shot, volley, etc.
- **Assist type** - Through-ball, cross, set-piece, etc.

Some models measure distance as where the shot was taken from, while others consider how the ball was delivered to the location before the shot.

### Additional Factors

More sophisticated models may include:

- Through-balls
- Free-kicks
- Corner kicks
- Whether it was a header or a normal shot
- Time of the game
- Defensive pressure
- Goalkeeper positioning
- Body part used

The number of factors can potentially reach **50+ features** depending on the complexity of the model.

## Building the Model

The idea is to predict what will happen to particular chances and events - whether they will be converted or not - using particular attributes of the data.

This is essentially a **classification problem**: given the features of a shot, predict whether it will be a goal (1) or not (0). The probability output by the model is the xG value.

### Machine Learning Approach

I used this opportunity to understand the importance of features through machine learning. By training a model on historical shot data, we can:

1. Predict the probability of any shot being scored
2. Identify which factors most influence goal-scoring
3. Evaluate player and team performance beyond raw goal counts

## Applications

xG has become a fundamental metric in modern football analytics:

- **Player evaluation** - Is a striker finishing chances above or below expectation?
- **Team analysis** - Are we creating good chances or relying on luck?
- **Match analysis** - Did the result reflect the balance of play?
- **Scouting** - Identify players who consistently outperform their xG

## Conclusion

Expected Goals provides a more nuanced view of football than simple goal counts. By understanding the quality of chances created and conceded, we can better evaluate performance and predict future outcomes.

This was my first attempt at building an xG model, and it opened my eyes to the fascinating intersection of data science and football analytics.
